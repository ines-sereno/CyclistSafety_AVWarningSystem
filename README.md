# External Early Warning System for Cyclist Safety

Developed an external visual signaling system to improve cyclist safety around autonomous vehicles during right-turn scenarios.

## Features
- Designed a ground-projection system using near-field visual cues
- Conducted human-centered experiments with eye-tracking and EMG
- Evaluated the effectiveness of different projections in alerting cyclists

## Tools & Technologies
- Experimental Design
- Human-Machine Systems
- Eye-Tracking (Tobii)
- Data Analysis

## Insights
- Simplified ground projections (car and arrow symbols) significantly improved cyclist caution and response
- Proposed a scalable AV safety enhancement for future deployments
